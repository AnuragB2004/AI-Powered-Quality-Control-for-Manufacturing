# Automated Defect Detection in Casting Products using GenAI

This project leverages **Generative AI** and **deep learning** to automatically detect defects in industrial casting products. By utilizing state-of-the-art architectures like **Xception**, **InceptionResNetV2**, and **MobileNet**, the project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quality inspections in manufacturing environments.

## Features
- **Defect Detection**: Classifies casting images as either Defective or OK.
- **Multiple Architectures**: Integrates various pre-trained models to improve classification accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies real-time augmentation to handle overfitting and improve generalization.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into model performance and defect classification through visual outputs.

## In-Scope
- Automated inspection using deep learning.
- Binary classification of casting defects.
- Performance comparison across different models.

## Out of Scope
- Real-time deployment on factory floors.
- Inspection of non-casting products.

## Future Opportunities
- Expanding the solution to other industries.
- Integrating edge computing for real-time inspections.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow, Keras
- Xception, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnuragB2004/AI-Powered-Quality-Control-for-Manufacturing.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Challenges
We encountered issues with **overfitting**, which were addressed by using **data augmentation** and tuning model parameters. Balancing model complexity for optimal performance was also a key challenge that required extensive evaluation of different architectures.
